The case setup for data generation is adapted from http://www.wolfdynamics.com/tutorials.html

1.) Generation of reference data: execute generateReferenceData.sh; the resulting time series is moved to referenceDataGeneration/data_referenceTimeSeries

2.) Generation of validation data (uniform inlet velocity 1.2 m/s): execute generateValidationData.sh; validation data is moved to validationDataGeneration/data_uin_120

3.) Generation of propagators: execute generatePropagator.sh; for each time in propagatorGeneration/listOfReferenceStates, the corresponding propagator is computed; this can take several days - to speed up the process, several copies propagatorGeneration0, propagatorGeneration1 etc. of propagatorGeneration may be created and the elements of listOfReferenceStates distributed among them; computations can be carried out in parallel and the resulting propagators found in propagatorGeneration0/dataBase, propagatorGeneration1/dataBase copied into one folder propagatorGeneration/dataBase

4.) If propagators have been successfully computed and converted into binary format (in addition to files X_uu_internal.txt, there are also files X_uu_internal etc.), intermediate files and propagators in ASCII format may be deleted to free disk space. To do so, execute cleanDatabase.sh
